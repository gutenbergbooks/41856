<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</a></h2>


<p>This Manual follows the lines of the "Manual of References and
Exercises," published in the autumn of 1916, to accompany the volume
on Economic Principles.</p>

<p>The literature of the field treated in "Modern Economic Problems"
is now so vast that no more than a few of the titles could be included
in the following lists. The references given are usually the more
recent of those that would be helpful to students desiring to go more
deeply into the subjects.</p>

<p>The collection of questions and exercises is based upon the list
printed, first in 1904 and much enlarged in 1910, in the author's
"Principles of Economics." Much material has been added that had
been shaped and used in class work at Princeton University, and a
few other problems have been drawn from, or suggested by, other
published lists. The plan of indicating the original sources of a number
of these questions has been found to be too difficult to be completed
for the present edition. Indeed, it appears that numerous test
problems have become a common heritage for economic teachers, and
one can hardly be sure when one has traced the ideas to their original
sources. Some of them have appeared in somewhat differing forms in
various lists for a half century past.</p>

<p>Particular acknowledgment is made to my colleagues, Professors
Adriance and McCabe, who devised a number of the questions for class
use; and to Dr. Stanley E. Howard, who has given most valuable aid
in the preparation of this Manual in its present form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Questions.</span></p>

<p>1. What are the functions of money?</p>

<p>2. <a name="tn04" id="tn04">What are the principal things besides money uses that cause a
demand for gold and silver?</a></p>

<p>3. Why do you value money? Do you value it more than the
things it buys?</p>

<p>4. When goods are exchanged for money or money for goods, what
is the gain?</p>

<p>5. If money is a tool, what does it make?</p>

<p>6. When gold comes out of the mine is the gain to the community
greater or less than when the same value of grain is harvested?</p>

<p>7. Are men wealthy in proportion to the money they have? Are
countries?</p>

<p>8. Would a nation be poorer, if, like Sparta, it prohibited all
money?</p>

<p>9. Is a community poor because it has little money in circulation
or does it have little money in circulation because it is poor?</p>

<p>10. Could a country better do without money, horses, or roads?</p>

<p>11. Why does nearly all the gold produced in California leave the
state? What keeps any of it there?</p>

<p>12. The mint price of an ounce of gold, .900 fine, is alike at San
Francisco and Philadelphia, $18.604. Why is gold ever shipped from
California to New York?</p>

<p>13. Does gold cost the day-laborer as much in California as in New
York?</p>

<p>14. Note any habits of friends that result in their carrying more
or less money than others of the same income.</p>

<p>15. What determines the amount of money needed by different persons,
towns, states, and nations?</p>

<p>16. Give examples of things that increase the demand for money.</p>

<p>17. On an isolated island would it make any difference as to the
value of money if there were but one gold-mine or several competing
ones, supposing that the output were the same?</p>

<p>18. What per cent. of the total money in the world is the yearly output
of gold; of silver; of gold and silver? Stat. Abst.</p>

<p>19. Is the value of gold and silver due to the action of government?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span></p>

<p>20. In what ways may the government determine the value of the
monetary standard?</p>

<p>21. If all the different denominations of media of exchange were
doubled in number, exchanges remaining unchanged, what would be
the effect upon prices?</p>

<p>22. Is it true of all commodities that changes in supply affect their
value proportionally? Is it true of money? If in your opinion there
is any difference, explain it.</p>

<p>23. If the amount of coal in a country should be increased twenty-five
per cent., in what percentage would you expect the value of coal
to change? Give reasons. If the amount of money in a country should
be increased twenty-five per cent., in what direction and in what
percentage would the value of money change? Give reasons. (In each
case the condition is "other things being equal.")</p>

<p>24. If in a given community all watch cases were made of gold, and
each case contained one ounce of gold, would you expect the value
of watch cases to fall by exactly one-half if the number of watch
cases in the community were doubled, all other things remaining the
same? If in another community (at another time) all exchanges
were made exclusively by the use of gold coins, each containing an
ounce of pure gold, would you expect that prices in general would
be exactly doubled in case no change occurred in the community except
a doubling of the number of coins in circulation?</p>

<p>25. Why might an increased resort to barter produce upon the
general level of money prices effects similar to those produced by an
increased use of credit media of exchange?</p>

<p>26. What gives rise to the belief sometimes held that money is an
invariable standard of value?</p>

<p>27. Define depreciation and appreciation of the currency. What
causes may produce either? What are the effects of either? More
generally, what determines the value of the currency?</p>

<p>28. If gold were to become as plentiful as iron, would it be worth
more or less than iron?</p>

<p>29. A nation having no foreign trade had originally in circulation
1,000,000 coins, each called a florin, and each containing an ounce
of pure metal. To this original coin circulation the government adds
500,000 florins each containing one-half ounce of pure metal, and at
the same time the government adds to the circulation 600,000 florins
in the shape of inconvertible paper. Both the half ounce florin and
the paper florin are by law made legal tender for a full weight florin.
In the absence of any tendency to discriminate between accepting different
kinds of florins in domestic trade, and with no other changes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
in the money situation except such as are necessitated by the aforesaid
additions to the circulating medium, tell, first, what ultimately
will be the number of florins in circulation, and give your reasons; and
tell, second, of what kinds of florins and in what proportions the ultimate
circulating medium will be composed.</p>

<p>30. Assume a country using gold alone as money and having in
circulation 2,000,000 coins, under a system of free coinage. What
would be the effect of closing the mints and issuing 1,500,000 new
coins containing nine-tenths as much gold as the coins above mentioned,
assuming that the number of goods exchanged remains the
same? Explain clearly. What is the total quantity of such new
coins the government can issue and keep in circulation? Explain
clearly.</p>

<p>31. A country using gold money as its sole medium of exchange,
under free and gratuitous coinage, makes the following change: it
imposes a seigniorage charge of ten per cent., but without giving up
free coinage or reducing the amount of fine gold in the coin. To what
extent and in what direction will the value of money change, if at all</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(a) if the number of goods exchanged gradually increases
five percent.;</p>

<p>(b) if the number of goods exchanged gradually increases
twenty-five percent.?</p></blockquote>

<p>Give your reasons clearly.</p>

<p>5. Under what conditions will "bad money" fail to displace "good
money" from circulation?</p>

<p>6. Under what circumstances will money that is not in fact convertible
into other money have greater value than the material of
which it (the first mentioned money) is made? Give an example
from the monetary experience of the United States.</p>

<p>7. In a country which has hitherto had free and gratuitous coinage
of gold, the government institutes a seigniorage charge of five
per cent. by reducing to that extent the amount of gold put into each
coin; the gold withheld by the government is not coined. What will
be the effect of this seigniorage charge upon (a) prices in that country,
(b) the comparative value of the gold in a new coin and the same
weight of uncoined gold? Make your reasoning clear.</p>

<p>8. If a nation's entire money circulation consisting of 1,000,000
coins, all of them debased by a seigniorage charge of 50 per cent., were
at once increased by the government's putting into circulation 300,000
pieces of inconvertible paper money, each <a name="tn05" id="tn05">
piece of the same denomination</a>
as each coin, what effects might be anticipated on the basis of
Gresham's law or otherwise, it being presupposed that the full amount
of full weight coin required to conduct the nation's exchanges is only
900,000? Give your reasons.</p>

<p>9. A certain island has no silver mines and no foreign trade.
It effects all its exchanges by the actual use of silver coin whose
coinage is free and gratuitous. It has no banks, and does not resort
either to barter or to credit. Silver is also used in the shape of plate
in the island. Originally it had 100,000 silver coins in circulation, each
containing one ounce of pure silver. After a certain date, as these
coins were paid into the government treasury for taxes, at the rate
of 5,000 one-ounce coins per week, the one-ounce coins were melted
and the resulting bullion was recast, each new coin weighing 2 ounces
and bearing the same name as the original one-ounce coins. Thereafter
all coins struck at the island Mint contained two ounces of silver, and
at that standard coinage continued free and gratuitous. When the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
government first pays out the new 2-ounce pieces, will they remain in
circulation with the old one-ounce coins and have the same purchasing
power? Give reasons.</p>

<p>10. If the above-described process of reminting 5,000 one-ounce coins
per week continues for twelve weeks and then stops, how many old
and how many new coins will at the end of the twelfth week be in
circulation? Reasons.</p>

<p>11. The government of the island of Guernsey having no money, issued
paper-notes to pay for the building of a market. They circulated
and were gradually taken up as the market earned its cost,
during ten years. When they were all redeemed and burned, the
island had the market free of cost. Explain how this could be done.
(From Sumner's Problems in political economy.)</p>

<p>12. Suppose a nation has 1,000,000,000 gold coins, each weighing
one ounce (Troy) as its only circulating medium. Suppose that the
government enacts that henceforth coins will be uttered containing
only 99 per cent. as much pure gold as heretofore, the government
taking one per cent. for its own use.</p>

<p>Suppose "other things remain the same." What effect will this
action have on the number of coins circulating?</p>

<p>Will prices be affected?</p>

<p>Now suppose the demand for money increases. Will bullion owners
bring their bullion to the mint for coinage?</p>

<p>Suppose this government had continued to utter coins of the same
weight and fineness as before, but had kept back one per cent. of the
bullion brought to the mint for its own use. Answer these three
questions in the light of this supposition.</p>

<p>13. Tabulate the index numbers, the greenback price of the gold
dollar, and the gold price of the greenback dollar, from 1861 to 1879.</p>

<p>14. Show the difference between convertible and inconvertible money.</p>

<p>15. Contrast the position of the commodity money theorists with
that of the fiat money theorists.</p>

<p>16. In a gold-standard country, one-half of whose monetary circulation
consists of silver dollars (which are unlimited legal tender) and
of silver certificates payable on demand in silver dollars (and supported
dollar for dollar by silver dollars in reserve), and whose
mints are closed to the free coinage of silver, how would the money
value of the silver dollars and silver certificates be affected if the
gold price of silver should fall (1) 10 per cent.? (2) 50 per cent?
(3) 5 per cent.? How would it be affected if the value of gold
should fall 10 per cent? (Free coinage of gold is assumed). Explain
the principles involved in your answer.</p>

<p>1. In which year between 1890 and the present year would a fixed
salary of $1,000 have gone farthest? In which year would its purchasing
power have been least? If a sum of $1,000 loaned in 1897 was
returned in 1902, what was the difference in its purchasing power
on its return and when it was loaned?</p>

<p>2. Will a day's work of a common laborer buy more to-day than
it would a half century ago? Why?</p>

<p>3. The Bureau of Labor's index number for 1912 was 133. What
was the percentage change in the value of money from the base period
to 1912? Give your reasons and your work.</p>

<p>Upon the basis of the prices of the above commodities estimate the
general price level for 1900, showing the percentage of its decline or
advance from the basal price level. Indicate some of the causes which
may have brought about this decline or advance.</p>

<p>5. At a given time the following commodity prices prevailed:
cotton (raw), $.10 per lb.; wheat, $1.00 per bu.; sugar, $.07 per lb.;
potatoes, $1.00 per bu.; beef (for roasting), $.25 per lb.; shoes, $5.00
per pair; cotton cloth of a standard grade, $.12 per yd.; woolen cloth
of a standard grade, $1.25 per yd.; men's hats, $4.00, and coal, $7.00
per ton.</p>

<p>At a later date the prices of the same commodities were respectively
as follows: $.13, $1.05, $.06, $1.10, $.30, $5.75, $.15, $1.20, $4.50
and $6.50.</p>

<p>Tabulate these facts and compute index numbers, which will show:</p>

<p>(1) changes in the price level of all ten commodities.</p>

<p>(2) changes in the price level of the articles of food.</p>

<p>(3) changes in the price level of the articles of clothing.</p>

<p>6. In the preceding exercise, do the data afford sufficient grounds
for saying that the cost of living has moved either upward or downward?</p>

<p>If an affirmative answer be assumed, what has been the change in
the value of money?</p>

<p>7. Assign to each of the commodities listed above a "weight"
which represents, in your opinion, its importance as an article of
popular consumption. Using this system of weights compute index
numbers to show changes in the price levels of the same groups of commodities.
<a name="tn08" id="tn08">How does the weighting affect your first conclusions regarding
the changes in the cost of living?</a> What is the importance of a system
of weighting?</p>

<p>8. If the world's annual production of gold should suddenly increase
five-fold, what would be the probable effect: upon the welfare
of a stock exchange speculator as compared with the welfare of a
teacher; upon the welfare of the creditor class as compared with that
of the debtor class; upon prices?</p>

<p>9. What is the function of the standard of deferred payments?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
What is that standard now in America? What change in it has lately
been going on? How is this affecting the incomes of various classes?</p>

<p>10. What ought to be the characteristics of a standard unit of
value?</p>

<p>11. Can you get a kind of money that will make the things that are
sold, dearer, and the things that are bought, cheaper?</p>

<p>12. Is the fact of one man's gain and another man's loss by chance
of any economic or political importance?</p>

<p>13. If every piece of money should miraculously be doubled in a
night, whose interests would be affected?</p>

<p>14. Compare the effect of an increasing gold output upon the price
of outstanding bonds with its effect upon the price of common stock
already issued.</p>

<p>15. X is an isolated industrial country with a certain volume of
money. Its government on a given day doubles the amount of currency.
What will be the effect upon the rate of interest.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(a) of long-time loans,</p>

<p>(b) of short-time loans, and</p>

<p>(c) of demand loans?</p></blockquote>

<p>16. The rate of interest on long-time investments in a certain
isolated community has been six per cent. The amount of money in
this community is increased so as to raise the general level of prices
by 100 per cent. Assuming that the increase in money has come
wholly from the more copious output of money-metal from the mines,
to what extent will this rise in the general level of prices affect the
rate of interest when thereafter capital is loaned for long-time periods?</p>

<p>17. Could a railway in the United States advantageously float a
large issue of 20-year bonds in the year 1916? Give reasons for your
answer. Show clearly what you mean by "advantageously." Would
a railroad wish to float such an issue if it could? Why?</p>

<p>18. Is there anything in the nature of mining that keeps the ratio
of the supply of gold and silver nearly uniform?</p>

<p>19. Some say Providence has indicated gold and silver as the materials
for money. How has this been done?</p>

<p>20. What are the main reasons given for the ratio of 16 to 1?</p>

<p>21. Does the principle of the substitution of goods have any bearing
on the value of metals under bimetallism?</p>

<p>22. What is the theory of money held by bimetallists?</p>

<p>23. "Inasmuch as gold (before 1848) was more valuable on the
world's market than at the French mint, relatively to silver, it was
impossible that gold should circulate in France." Is this a necessary
conclusion?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span></p>

<p>24. What arguments advanced in favor of bimetallism in 1896 are
inapplicable to-day?</p>

<p>25. What is the extent of the influence one nation can have on the
ratio of the two precious metals?</p>

<p>26. How would the adoption of international bimetallism to-day at
the ratio of 32 to 1 affect (a) the circulating medium, (b) the
standard of value in different countries? Consider both the immediate
and the eventual results.</p>

<p>27. What would have happened if a free silver law had been enacted
in the United States in 1900?</p>

<p>28. Would an ideal monetary standard always measure the same
quantity of goods?</p>

<p>29. A owes B a long term debt, which falls due just before the
commencement of a commercial crisis; would it be to the advantage
or disadvantage of A if the contract called for payment in terms of a
tabular standard?</p>

<p>30. Why has not the tabular standard of deferred payments come
into common use? Is the tabular standard sound or unsound in principle?
Would your answer apply to the labor standard?</p>

<p>14. How would the balance sheet of a commercial bank issuing an
ordinary asset bank-note currency stand after the following operations?</p>

<p>The bank opens business with a paid-up capital of $2,000,000 and a
surplus of $400,000. It spends $50,000 in its own bank notes for
furniture and fixtures. It discounts at six per cent. for various customers
$4,000,000 of 60-day notes and bills receivable, the borrowers
taking one-fourth of the proceeds in cash, one-fourth in the bank's
own bank notes, and leaving the balance on deposit. Customers cash
checks on their accounts for $600,000 receiving two-thirds of the
amount in the bank's own bank notes and the other third in coin and
other kinds of "lawful money." Other customers make deposits of
$900,000, of which one-third is in "lawful money," one-third in the
bank's own bank notes, and one-third in the checks of other depositors
in the same bank. The bank buys at par $1,200,000 of railroad bonds,
paying for them in its own bank notes. It pays with its own bank
notes expenses for wages, stationery and taxes to the amount of $10,000.
(b) What percentage of reserve is it carrying at the end of
these operations?</p>

<p>What can you learn from this statement about the kind of business
which the bank is carrying on, and its power to withstand a financial
storm?</p>

<p>16. How would the balance sheet of a commercial bank stand after
the following operations? The bank begins business with a paid-up
capital of $300,000 and a surplus of $60,000. It discounts for customers
$600,000 of four-months notes and bills receivable, at 6 per
cent., the borrowers taking one third of the proceeds in cash (i.e.,
lawful money), and leaving two-thirds on deposit. Customers deposit
$200,000, of which one-half is in cash, one-quarter is in checks drawn
on this bank, and one-quarter is in checks drawn on other banks.</p>

<p>17. Suppose that this bank now reorganizes as a national bank and,
to secure the privilege of note issue, buys United States 2 per cent.
bonds of a par value of $90,000 at <a name="tn10" id="tn10">$102.</a> These bonds it deposits
with the Treasurer of the United States and receives the full amount
of national bank notes to which it is entitled. Depositors withdraw
by check $180,000, the bank giving them $45,000 in its notes and the
balance in lawful money. A dividend of 2 per cent. is declared, and
is paid, one-half in lawful money and one-half in the form of deposits.
Present the balance sheet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Questions.</span></p>

<p>1. Explain the method followed by national banks in issuing bank
notes. Why did the banks often find it more profitable to use their
money in other ways than by issuing bank notes? Ref.: Discussion in
various reports of Comptroller of the Currency.</p>

<p>2. Section 28 of the National Bank Act of June 3, 1864, after providing
that a national banking association may hold real estate "necessary
for its immediate accommodation in the transaction of its business"
and such other real estate and mortgages thereupon as it may
have taken to secure debts previously contracted, provides that "Such
associations (national banks) shall not purchase or hold real estate in
any other case or for any other purpose...."</p>

<p>(a) What is the reason for the above provision?</p>

<p>(b) Would it be wise to make a similar prohibition on savings
banks?</p>

<p>3. Describe the clearing house and define its economic advantages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span></p>

<p>4. If there are twenty banks in a town and no clearing house, how
many collections would have to be made by all the banks daily assuming
that each day depositors of each bank receive checks on the
other nineteen banks?</p>

<p>5. Does a clearing house enable the banks that belong to it to get
along with a smaller cash reserve?</p>

<p>1. Name and contrast the different kinds of banks in the United
States.</p>

<p>2. How are notes issued under the Federal Reserve Act?</p>

<p>3. If on a given date the surplus reserve (i.e., the reserve in excess
of the legal minimum reserve required by law to be held against
deposits) of the New York Associated Banks amounts to $11,000,000,
and the deposits on the same date amount to $1,164,000,000, what is
the total cash reserve held by the banks on said date? What would it
have been in 1912?</p>

<p>4. The "New York Times" of December 8, 1916, said:</p>

<p>"The rediscounting of commercial paper at the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York by some of the city's largest banks on Wednesday had
the effect yesterday of improving general money market conditions.
Call loans which were made at 15 per cent. on Monday, and as high
as 10 per cent. on Tuesday, and touched seven per cent. Wednesday,
were placed yesterday at from three to five per cent. Most of the
loans were made at four and one-half per cent., the renewal rate, and
the closing quotation was three per cent. Time money rates were
easier."</p>

<p>Explain the process of rediscounting here referred to. In just what
way did the rediscounting operations relieve the call money market?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
Do you consider that this use of the rediscounting facilities provided
by the Federal Reserve System was in accord with sound banking
principles? Was it the best possible use of the rediscounting mechanism?
For suggestions see the "New York Times" of December 5, 1916,
under the heading "Financial Markets."</p>

<p>1. What is a financial crisis? An industrial depression?</p>

<p>2. Describe the trade, banking and price conditions which obtain
just preceding, during and immediately following a crisis.</p>

<p>3. State clearly and explain the movement of prices of stocks, bonds,
mortgages, land, commodities generally, wages and interest rates on
long time and short time loans, before, during, and after a crisis.</p>

<p>4. Tabulate for a series of years covering periods of prosperity and

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span></p>

<p>5. What economic changes occurred in your own community in the
panic of 1893-94, or in the years 1903-04, or in 1907-08?</p>

<p>6. Is it possible that the amount of all goods produced shall be in
excess of the community's power of consumption?</p>

<p>7. "As the average American can produce far more than he can
consume, it has been proved repeatedly that as long as the sale of his
products is confined to the home markets, over-production is certain to
be a natural consequence of every prolonged period of activity. For
half a century, therefore, with regularly recurring seasons of surplus
production, there came those inevitable commercial crises which emphasized
with increasing force the necessity for foreign markets."
(This passage is taken from a reprint of a speech of a congressman.)</p>

<p>Criticize the view as to the cause of commercial crises expressed
in the above statement.</p>

<p>8. Is a crisis caused by too much or too little money, or by some
other influence?</p>

<p>9. If there were twice as much money in the world, would panics
take place?</p>

<p>10. In a period of depression is there less money than usual in the
country? In the banks?</p>

<p>11. In what ways and to what extent are trade conditions apt to
be affected by:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The increasing gold supply?</p>

<p>The trust movement?</p>

<p>Increasing armies and navies?</p>

<p>The agricultural situation?</p></blockquote>

<p>12. Explain the difference in the motive of the borrower at ordinary
times and in times of panic.</p>

<p>13. How are loans affected when the reserve limit as established
either by law or custom is reached in England, Germany and the
United States?</p>

<p>14. What in your opinion is the correct explanation of crises?</p>

<p>15. In what ways is business affected by the condition of the crops?
Within what limitations? In the case of which crops is the connection
closest?</p>

<p>16. What element of security is furnished by clearing houses during
panics?</p>

<p>17. Describe the method used by the banks in meeting demands of
depositors during the panics of 1893 and of 1907. (Dunbar is especially
valuable. Also O. M. W. Sprague, History of crises under the

<p>2. What is the essential economic difference between gambling and
insurance?</p>

<p>3. Give examples showing the difference between a gambling house
and an insurance company?</p>

<p>4. Investors in Russian bonds are said to take out policies of insurance
payable to themselves in the event of the Czar's death, their object
being to guard themselves against loss by the depreciation of their
Russian securities in case of political disturbances that might emerge
upon a change of rulers.</p>

<p>(a) Do you regard such insurance as gambling or legitimate speculation
from the standpoint of either insurer or insured?</p>

companies as "sound"?</p>

to insure themselves against fire. If the risk for the class of buildings
involved in such that seven out of 1,000 burn each year, what
annual payment from each owner would be necessary to insure all
against total loss&mdash;expenses of management, interest, etc., being ignored?

<p>7. Suppose that a corporation owns 500 buildings worth $100,000
each; that to insure against fire in an ordinary company would cost
$250 for each building; and that the corporation is convinced that by
the expenditure of $10,000 the fire loss can be reduced to an average
of one building every three years. Would it pay the corporation to
insure with some company? (F. M. Taylor.)</p>

cents per bushel, corn at 40 cents per bushel and potatoes at 40 cents
per bushel. Community B can produce wheat at 70 cents per bushel,
corn at 45 cents per bushel and potatoes at 42 cents per bushel. Supposing

sterling bills of exchange will sell at $4.875 in the New York exchange
market.</p>

<p>13. If the merchandise imports from England to the United States
equalled the exports from the United States to England, what would
be the state of exchange on London? Would there be any greater
advantage to either of the countries engaged in trade?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Questions.</span></p>

<p>1. Can it be of advantage to trade freely with one nation if general
free trade is bad?</p>

<p>2. If there were no legal bar to a tariff between the states, would
a tariff probably be imposed? If so, would it be a wise measure?</p>

<p>3. Discuss the contention that a protective tariff by helping to
keep out imports of foreign goods tends to maintain a favorable balance
of trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span></p>

<p>4. "The territorial distribution of money is both a determined and
a determining factor in international trade."</p>

<p>Explain the meaning of this statement and show its relation to the
"favorable balance of trade" argument for protection.</p>

<p>5. An Englishman gave this argument for protection: "If an Englishman
buys a frying pan from a German for a shilling (24 cents),
then England gets the frying pan and Germany gets the shilling,
whereas if an Englishman buys the frying pan from an English manufacturer
for 13 pence (26 cents), England gets both the frying pan
and the 13 pence. The increase in price benefits England because the
money remains within the country, instead of going abroad to increase
the wealth of foreign nations." Give your opinion of this
argument.</p>

<p>6. Discuss this statement: "The American people send abroad over
$100,000,000 a year to pay for imported sugar. To meet this bill requires
the wheat crop of over 7,100,000 acres. But all the sugar now
imported could be grown on 1,700,000 acres in beets or cane. In other
words we are throwing away the product of approximately 5,400,000
acres of land by not growing our own sugar."</p>

<p>7. A New York daily has contended that "Of course, we should be
the gainers if every pound of it (raw cotton) were exported in manufactured
form. Every process through which the raw material passes
in its conversion into fabrics would mean employment for American
wage-earners."</p>

<p>Discuss the proposition that the aggregate for the labor of American
wage-earners is less if we export raw cotton than if we should
manufacture the raw cotton in this country for export.</p>

<p>8. Assuming that an import duty on tea, if sufficiently high, would
create a tea growing industry in the United States capable of supplying
the whole domestic demand, trace the various economic effects of such
a duty.</p>

<p>9. Who gained when Hawaiian sugar (before annexation) was admitted
free of duty, while other sugar was taxed?</p>

<p>10. If the owners of marble quarries can show that their net income
is 30 per cent. greater by reason of the protective tariff upon
foreign marbles, does this show that the tariff increases the wealth
of the protecting country?</p>

<p>11. State any proposition which you think that you can maintain
about the relation between high or low wages and international competition.
Maintain your proposition.</p>

<p>12. What do you say to the plan of so adjusting duties on imports
as to equalize the "labor cost" of imported and domestic commodities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
through the levy of duties which will just offset the higher wages paid
by the American employer?</p>

<p>13. Is a high rate of money wages an obstacle to the successful conduct
of industry in competition with countries where money wages are
low?</p>

<p>14. What was the argument originally used as to the comparative
wage levels here and abroad so far as the starting of certain industries
in this country was concerned? Compare this argument with the
current protectionist argument as to the relation between the tariff
and the present general wage level in the United States.</p>

<p>15. What help should the law of wages give in explaining the present
inequality as among the wage scales in Germany, France, England and
the U. S.?</p>

<p>16. If it would pay us to admit goods free, may we be justified in
taxing them to force concessions from the other country?</p>

<p>17. What conditions as to consumption and production at home and
abroad would be most favorable to the shifting of an import duty on
a manufactured article entirely to the consumer?</p>

<p>18. (a) A and B are two tropical islands inhabited by friendly peoples
and producing the same commodities. The climate, soil and topography
of A are such that all kinds of products can be produced there
with less effort than they can be produced in B. Could there be any
incentive for the people of A to trade with the people of B?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(b) Debarring all feelings of hostility and of sentimental attachment
to home, is there any reason why the people of B should not all
emigrate to A?</p>

<p>(c) Could B equalize conditions of production by enacting a protective
tariff on the products of the two islands?</p>

<p>(d) Suppose A were discovered after a strong civilization had
grown up on B. Might conditions be such that A could with advantage
to itself exact a protective tariff?</p></blockquote>

<p>1. Are the opportunities for workmen to rise to the rank of masters
as great as formerly?</p>

<p>2. What are the chief causes of the origin and rise of trade
unions? Distinguish between a trade union and a labor union.</p>

<p>3. What are the conditions favorable to national agreements between
trade unions and employers' associations? Explain clearly the
bearing of each of these conditions.</p>

<p>4. Describe the practices included under the term "direct action,"
and contrast with the methods of collective bargaining and legislation.</p>

<p>5. Are strikes becoming more or less frequent and important in
your state? In answer to this question give figures from 1881 on if
obtainable, showing number of strikes; establishments affected and to
what extent; loss in wages and to employers. Diagram the figures.
Ref., U. S. Bu. of Labor, Annual report, 1906.</p>

<p>6. Do trade unions increase or decrease the number of strikes?</p>

<p>7. If you were an officer of a trade-union, would you begin a strike
when trade was good or when it was poor?</p>

<p>8. Does it make any difference in the permanence of an increase of
wages brought about by a strike, whether the employer is one of the
more successful or one of the less successful in that business?</p>

<p>9. Give examples of the different kinds of boycott. What seems to
be the attitude of the federal courts as to the lawfulness of boycotts?</p>

<p>10. Is there any similarity between the methods of trade unions
and the etiquette of the medical and the legal professions?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span></p>

<p>11. Some trade unions limit the number of apprentices in their
trades. Is this a justifiable policy on their part?</p>

<p>12. Of the methods employed by trade unions to raise the wages of
their members, which are prejudicial and which are not prejudicial to
the interests of the rest of the community, including non-union labor?
Give reasons.</p>

<p>13. Can wages be affected by the "collective bargaining" of trade
unions and if so indicate in that connection a justification (if one
exists) for trade union organization.</p>

<p>14. If a trade union sets a minimum rate of wages lower than the
competitive market rate would be in the absence of organization,
which rate would the members receive? State the facts from the
Source Book which lead you to your answer.</p>

<p>15. Have trade unions raised or lowered the wages of non-union
labor?</p>

<p>16. What is the attitude of American trade unions toward efficiency
systems as attempts to introduce improved methods of production (not
systems of payment)?</p>

<p>2. Explain the terms "the new immigration" and "the old immigration,"
and give the important statistical facts regarding them.</p>

<p>3. Show the application of the doctrine of population to the present
problem of immigration and wages in America.</p>

legislation restricting immigration?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span></p>

<p>5. What has been the effect of the recent immigration into the
United States upon the use of machinery?</p>

<p>6. Apply the theory of wages to explain the effect of present immigration
on the wages of unskilled or slightly skilled workers.</p>

<p>7. If the supply of labor of any class were to be decreased ten per
cent., would wages rise in like proportion?</p>

<p>8. Is immigration now adding to the general welfare in the United
States? State the facts and general economic principles on which
you base your answer.</p>

<p>9. If there is an immigration of half a million workers annually
into a country for a period of ten years&mdash;during which no new natural
resources are made available, would wages in that country be affected?
If so, of what classes of workers? What would be the effect on the

<p>10. Explain how the general principles of price-determination hold
in the determination of wages. Show how these principles apply when
there is extensive employment of southern and eastern Europeans.
(See Source Book.)</p>

<p>11. If in a given labor market the number of laborers increases
while the number and technical efficiency of indirect agents remains
unchanged, what change, if any, will result in the average rate of
wages? What change, if any, will there be in the return to the indirect
agents?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Questions.</span></p>

<p>1. Cite any instances you have noted of local changes of population
distribution as between country and city. What are the chief facts
of interest in these cases? What forces can you assign as causes of
the changes? Has agricultural activity been accelerated or retarded?
Has it received a set-back?</p>

<p>2. A wealthy metropolitan banker purchases a large country estate
in a section in which farming is practically on a subsistence basis
and in which in recent years many farms have been abandoned. He
applies labor and materials lavishly to the soil, sparing no expenditures
for purposes which will assist in the production of crops of
the best quality. Under what conditions can this be profitably done?
What will be the probable effect on local agriculture, (a) if the entire
product of the estate is consumed upon it? (b) if a substantial
part of the product is marketed in competition with that of the
local farmers? What changes are likely to occur with reference to the
occupation of the local population? With reference to its migration?</p>

<p>3. Why is it that immigrants are now taking up the farms of New
England which have, in some cases for years, been abandoned by native
farmers? Is the fact that they are doing so an argument for or
against the restriction of immigration?</p>

<p>4. What is the general tendency of immigrants in the matter of settlement
in urban and rural communities?</p>

<p>5. If it is true that the relative decline of the agricultural population
of the United States can be explained by the operation of purely
economic forces, on what grounds is there justification for complaint
as to the evils of concentration of population in cities?</p>

than in Europe?</p>

<p>2. Show in what way natural waterways have determined the location
of leading cities in America.</p>

<p>3. Give examples of cities whose growth has been caused by railroads.</p>

<p>4. Upon what considerations are commodities classified for shipment
by railroads? Is classification unfair discrimination? Illustrate
by an example.</p>

<p>5. What classes of interests are affected by increasing the minimum
weight for carloads? Explain in each case whether the effect is
favorable or unfavorable and the reasons therefor.</p>

<p>6. Does cost of service have anything to do with the rates charged
by railroads?</p>

<p>7. Give an example of a blanket rate territory and the reasons
therefor.</p>

<p>8. What is the "long and short haul" clause of the Interstate
Commerce Act? Explain why railroads make rates which contravene
the terms of this clause, and why the government should forbid the
railroads to make such rates.</p>

<p>9. A railroad connecting two competitive points charges one-fourth
of a cent per ton mile on grain shipments from its inland terminus,
while it charges one cent per ton mile on grain shipments from non-competitive
territory. What considerations have probably led to the
establishment of the above rates?</p>

<p>Might not the railroad increase its net revenue by raising the rate
on through traffic to one-half cent per ton mile and lowering the local
rate to three-fourths of a cent per ton mile?</p>

<p>10. The rate on corn in carload lots from Omaha, Neb. to Newport
News, Va. is 10 cents per hundred pounds. From the Omaha region
there are competing carriers to the Gulf and other Atlantic ports.
The rate on corn in carload lots from points in Virginia to Newport
News over the same route is 12 cents per hundred pounds. Could not
the local rates be lowered if the carriers advanced the rates on the
long-distance haul?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span></p>

on the public?</p>

<p>12. Give instances you have seen or heard of where two shippers
paid different rates for the same service.</p>

<p>13. Do you know any large cities that are more favorable shipping
points than neighboring towns?</p>

<p>14. What legal rights do the builders of a railroad have that are
not enjoyed by all citizens?</p>

<p>15. Can you see any clear distinction between the public nature of
a railroad and that of a horse and carriage?</p>

<p>16. What harm can there be in the acceptance of passes by judges,
legislators, and other public officials?</p>

<p>17. Ought the law prohibit the sale of tickets by "scalpers"?</p>

<p>18. If your neighbor rides on a pass and you pay your fare, are
you helping to pay for his ride?</p>

<p>19. Why should preachers get half-fare rates?</p>

<p>20. What are the chief reasons for the governmental regulation of
railways?</p>

<p>21. Why does the question of the control of the railways in the interest
of the public present especial difficulties in America?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Questions.</span></p>

<p>1. What large trusts have recently been formed?</p>

<p>2. State the motives for forming trusts, separating those which
are socially beneficial and those which are anti-social.</p>

<p>3. Enumerate the advantages possessed by a "trust" over a small
competitor, and indicate which of these are the results of large scale
production and which are due to the possession of monopoly power.</p>

<p>4. Are there any conditions under which a combination would be
a more economical unit of production and distribution than a single
plant large enough to secure all advantages to be obtained from mere
quantity of output? If so, state them clearly.</p>

<p>5. Explain carefully the causes and limits of the advantages of
large production. Give three examples of industries in which the advantages
are seen.</p>

<p>6. Have you observed the growth of any local industry from a small
beginning to large proportions? If so, how do you account for it?</p>

<p>7. What is the largest manufacturing establishment in your home
town? Would a number of smaller establishments of the same sort
and with the same aggregate capacity succeed as well? Why?</p>

<p>8. What relation has improved transportation and other means of
communication to trusts?</p>

<p>9. What are the chief methods by which trusts or combinations
have sought to make economies in management?</p>

<p>10. Describe the characteristic features of the pool, the trust and the
holding company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span></p>

<p>11. Describe any agreement of which you know, made between merchants
or manufacturers for the purpose of regulating prices. Did
prices go up or down as a result?</p>

<p>12. What is a simple price agreement? How does it differ from a
pool? Is there any difference in the matter of legality? Reasons.</p>

<p>13. What are the limits to the price-fixing and profit-earning powers
of monopolies? Are there any other conditions which will tend to
check the indefinite growth of combinations?</p>

<p>14. Explain and illustrate by a concrete example the circumstances
relating to cost of production which tend to make a monopoly price
lower than the previous competitive price for the same article. No
reference is here intended to local or temporary cuts in price by monopolies
which are intent by such means on capturing a local market.</p>

<p>15. If all trade is exchange, do not the members of a trust reduce
their income when they raise the price of their products by artificial
agreement?</p>

<p>16. Five plants engaged in the production of a given article in different
parts of the United States are combined under the ownership
of a single corporation formed for this purpose. Before the combination
<a name="tn17" id="tn17">these five plants produced 75 per cent.</a> of the total output of the
article in question, each producing approximately 15 per cent.; the
remaining 75 per cent. was produced by seven plants, no one of these
turning out more than 5 per cent. of the total output. Each of the
first five plants was large enough to secure all known economies in
the costs of transforming the raw material into the physically finished
product, and each was running to its full capacity. The aggregate
net earnings of the five plants were $1,000,000 a year. The cost
of reproducing these five is $14,000,000. The new corporation issues
and pays to the owners of the properties taken over $10,000,000 in
5 per cent. first mortgage bonds, $6,000,000 in cumulative preferred
stock, and $8,000,000 in common stock.</p>

<p>What will determine whether this combination possesses monopoly
power?</p>

<p>Is the corporation overcapitalized? If so, to what extent? State
clearly what you mean by overcapitalization?</p>

<p>Is it probable that the earnings of the new corporation will be
greater than the aggregate earnings of the five plants, if the price of
the product is not increased? If so, how will this increase be gained?</p>

<p>If there is an increase in earnings, how will the price of each of
the three kinds of securities of the corporation be affected?</p>

<p>17. Suppose that the effective demand for a certain kind of goods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
in the country as a whole will vary in the following manner with
the price changes indicated:</p>

<table class="centered" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="" width="75%">
<tr><td align="right">$1.00 </td><td align="right">        1,000,000 units</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1.10</td><td align="right"> 900,000 units</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1.20</td><td align="right"> 800,000 units</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1.30</td><td align="right"> 700,000 units</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1.40</td><td align="right">600,000 units</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1.50</td><td align="right"> 500,000 units</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1.60</td><td align="right"> 400,000 units</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1.70</td><td align="right"> 300,000 units</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1.80</td><td align="right">200,000 units</td></tr>
</table>

<p>There are ten companies each producing 100,000 units at a cost
of 90 cents (including all costs but an allowance for dividends on
investment) this giving just enough of a margin to each company
to cause it to continue in the industry. What immediate effect on
prices could a combination consisting of six firms have, assuming
that the cost per unit of product and that the output of the independents
remain unchanged? Show for each of the prices indicated
what the amount of the margin made by the four independent competitors
(altogether) and by the combination would be. What less
immediate effects would be likely to follow, and why?</p>

<p>18. Is granting patents an interference with trade similar to tariffs?</p>

<p>19. Is it right that the lucky inventor of a popular toy should
make $100 a day from it?</p>

<p>20. Is it right that an inventor should by patent laws be able to
keep the profits of his business high?</p>

<p>1. What is the trust problem?</p>

<p>2. Does the public consider the growth of trusts to be good or
bad? What do students of the question think of it?</p>

<p>3. Which one of the following views do you think to be nearest
the truth and why? (a) The trust is a natural and inevitable outcome
of modern conditions and is a distinct economic gain. (b) The
trust is a result of special privileges and corporate abuses. (c) The
trust is the greatest invention of this or any other age.</p>

<p>4. Would it be a good thing for society if a trust made great
economies in production, crowded out its smaller competitors, and
maintained prices just where they were before, dividing among its
shareholders the amounts saved?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Questions.</span></p>

<p>1. In the last analysis is there anyone&mdash;retired capitalist or unskilled
day-worker&mdash;whose title to the real income he receives is
derived solely from the property he owns, or solely from the labor
he performs?</p>

<p>2. What is it to earn a living? How many people do it?</p>

<p>3. If capital is needed in production why is the question of justice
raised when its use is paid for?</p>

<p>4. What is the doctrine of economic harmonies? Give three examples
(distinct in kind) in modern legislation which run counter to this
doctrine, with the <a name="tn20" id="tn20">justification</a> for each of these.</p>

<p>5. Define charity. Apply the general principles of charity to free
schools, free libraries, and free clothing to school children.</p>

<p>6. What is economic freedom? How different from political freedom?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span></p>

<p>7. Is custom a better regulator of economic action than competition?</p>

<p>8. What are vested rights? Do they ever stand in the way of
progress? Examples.</p>

<p>9. Distinguish between the socialistic and the competitive principles
of distribution.</p>

<p>10. What classes of thinkers are most inclined to take up socialism?
(Classes considered socially, industrially, as to race, as to economic
and historical training.)</p>

<p>11. If socialism reduced the total product, would it still be desirable
because of the better distribution?</p>

<p>12. What effect would it have if the state should make laborers
work for <a name="tn21" id="tn21">unsuccessful</a> employers at lower wages than for successful
ones? Or should reduce rents for the less capable merchants and
manufacturers?</p>

<p>13. Is there any rule for determining the limits of state interference?</p>

<p>14. If you had the power, what single public measure that you believe
would be practicable and effective would you put on the statute
books, in order to make a juster division of the social income? Give
reasons.</p>

<p>15. The wealth of the United States increased from $7,000,000,000
in 1850 to $188,000,000,000 in 1912. How was this wealth distributed
according to (a) the socialistic theory of value? (b) the single tax
theory? (c) the theory of value under competitive conditions?</p>

<p>16. What are the chief ways in which the rule of competitive value
has been nullified in this period.</p>

<p>17. Would socialism guarantee steadiness or regularity in economic
activity, thus eliminating the phenomena of economic crises and
depressions?</p>

<p>18. In what way does taxation now shift the distribution of real incomes
as among persons? By what other methods and in what degree
could such taxation be extended?</p>

 <div class='transnote'><h2>Transcriber's Notes:</h2>
<p> All errors and inconsistencies in spelling, punctuation, and italicization
have been retained, except as noted below.</p>

<p>The original did not have a table of contents;
one has been added. </p>


<p> On p. 9, the title '<a href="#tn02">The geography of
commerce</a>' had a lower case 't' in 'The' in the original.</p>

<p> On p. 10, the question <a href="#tn03">'What is meant by the "Factory System"?'</a>
appeared in the original as 'What is meant by the "Factory System."'</p>

<p> On p. 12, the question <a href="#tn04">'What are the principal things
besides money
uses that cause a demand for gold and silver?'</a> had a full stop (period)
instead of a question mark in the original.</p>

<p> On p. 15, in the phrase <a href="#tn05">'piece of the same denomination'</a>
the original
had 'demonination'.</p>

<p> On p. 17, in the reference to <a href="#tn06">'chs. VI, VII, XIII.'</a> the name
'Phillips' was not italicized in the original.</p>

<p> In the table at the top of p. 18 labelled 'Average prices for', there
was no comma after <a href="#tn07">'Wool'</a> in the original.</p>

<p> On p. 18 the penultimate sentence in question 7, with the phrase
<a href="#tn08">'weighting affect your first'</a>, lacked a question mark in the original.</p>

<p> On p. 21 question 9, about 'Two men A and B', had 'transacton' instead
of <a href="#tn09">'transaction'</a> in the original.</p>

<p> On p. 23, question 17, 'Suppose that this bank...', had two full stops
(periods) instead of one after <a href="#tn10">'$102'.</a></p>

<p> On p. 38, the hanging indent (if any) after the reference beginning
 <a href="#tn11">'Virtue,'</a>
was a regular indent in the original.</p>

<p> On p. 42, in the reference beginning 'United States', the abbreviation
<a href="#tn12">'Bul.'</a> was italicized in the original, although it was not italicized in
its other occurrences.</p>

<p> On p. 44, the word <a href="#tn13">'and'</a> in the reference beginning 'Warren, B.' was
italicized in the original.</p>

<p> On p. 46, the hanging indent, if any, after the reference to <a href="#tn14">'The work of rural
organization'</a> was a normal indent in the original.</p>

<p> On p. 47, the author of 'Tenancy in the southern states', <a href="#tn15">B. H.
Hibbard</a> was shown as H. E. Hibbard in the original.</p>

<p> On p. 49, the question <a href="#tn16">'How do urban and rural...'</a> had a full stop
(period) instead of a question mark in the original.</p>

<p> On p. 53, presumably either the phrase <a href="#tn17">'these five plants produced 75
per cent.'</a> was meant to be 'these five plants produced 25 per cent.' or
the phrase 'the remaining 75 per cent.' was meant to be 'the remaining
25 per cent.'</p>

<p> On p. 55, the initials of <a href="#tn18">LeRossignol</a> were not italicized in the
original.</p>

<p> On p. 56, the phrase <a href="#tn19">'its prices elsewhere'</a> was 'its prices elsewere'
in the original.</p>

<p> On p. 58, in the question about the 'doctrine of economic harmonies',
the word <a href="#tn20">'justification'</a> was 'justificaton' in the original.</p>

<p> On p. 59, the question about <a href="#tn21">'unsuccessful employers'</a> had
'unsuccesful' in the original.</p>

<p> The phrase <a href="#tn22a">'land owners'</a> occurs once in the text; the word
'land-owners', broken across lines, occurs once. This discrepancy has
been retained, with the word <a href="#tn22b">'land-owners'</a> rather than 'landowners'
being arbitrarily chosen for the latter.</p>
